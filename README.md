## objective
* WHEN I load their portfolio
* THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them  
  
* WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
* THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section  
  
* WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
* THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications  
  
* WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
* THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others  

* WHEN I click on the images of the applications
* THEN I am taken to that deployed application

* WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
* THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

## What I Learned
* utilizing flexbox's ability of shrink/grow was essential for the transition within each media size range.
* start with a simple design to obtain mvp. then once the functionality is complete add style.
* keeping a log of class names and ids for quick reference is very beneficial.
* using flexible values for width and height specs saves a great deal of time switching between media breakpoints.

## Future Improvements
* Styling the pseudo-classes would increase user engagement.
